## 🚀 Project Overview

This application is designed as an **e-commerce–style platform** where users can browse and purchase products, while administrators manage products, orders, and users.

The system uses **role-based access control** to differentiate functionality between **Users** and **Admins**, ensuring secure access to sensitive operations such as product modification and user monitoring.

## 🏗️ Application Architecture

- **Frontend (React.js)**  
  Handles UI rendering, user interactions, and API requests.

- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)**  
  Manages authentication, authorization, business logic, and API endpoints.

- **Database (MongoDB)**  
  Stores users, products, orders, and role-related data.

The frontend communicates with the backend using **secure REST APIs**, and all sensitive configurations are managed through environment variables.
